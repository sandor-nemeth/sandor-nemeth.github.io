So here we are at the beginning of 2018, and it's time for those damned resolutions. But this year, I will be making this process as it should be: open, transparent, honest. For this I am also going to set up some [SMART] goals, so that I am able to keep track of my progress. In the following few days, I'll update my post with initial measurements, so that I have a baseline to which I can compare my progress. To sum it up, the following is my new years resolution:

1. I will be setting SMART goals this year.
2. I will publish this post until the 5th of January, along with a baseline.
3. I will post a status report every month. 

This will help me keep track of everything that I would like to achieve. I will be setting multiple goals for this year, and here I publish them categorized:

## Category 1: Software development

## Category 3: Publishing and public appearance

## Category 2: Health
