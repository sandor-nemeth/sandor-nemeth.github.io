title: Running Spring Cloud on Swarm
---

_Note: I'll update this post in installments, and at the end I'll create a TOC also. But as this'll be a lather large post, I'll keep updating this post until it is finished._

Uh, I need to apologise, I wasn't really thinking that I won't have that much time inbetween the last post and now. However as Christmas is around I have some time to summarize my thoughts on how to build a [Swarm] cluster, and then put a (mostly) complete Spring Cloud environment on it - supporting Swarm features like `docker service scale`. 

So in this post, I'll dig deep into the code and deployment instructions, and I'll be setting up the following software:

- Service Discovery: Spring Cloud Eureka 
- Central Configuration: Spring Cloud Config Server
- Trace: Spring Cloud Zipkin
- API Gateway: Spring Cloud Zuul
- And a few applications for demonstration purposes.

## Service Discovery - Eureka



## Centralized configuration management - Spring Cloud Config server

## Tracing - Zipkin

## API Gateway - Zuul

## Demo applications
