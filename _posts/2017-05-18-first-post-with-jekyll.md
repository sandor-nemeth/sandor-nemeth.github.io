title: First post with Jekyll
---

So, this is my first post using Jekyll, on Github pages. It was
suprisingly easy to set this up.

```java
System.out.println("Hello from Java code also");
```

And seems like everything is working, also source code!

To be honest I was never really good at blogging, but I'll give it
another try, because I think it would be a very satisfying thing to
write out the things I experience every day.
