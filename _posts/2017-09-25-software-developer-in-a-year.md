title: You do not become a software developer in 1 year
---
OK, this'll be a rant, if I hurt anybody, I do apologise.

I just read [this article], and I am just speechless. On the title. 

Now first of all, let me start with the following: I have to tip my hat to [@madisonkenna] because I do not know many people who can switch careers, and I know how much dedication her new chosen field requires. I totally applaud her for that. Also, I think what she did is totally awesome! Taking first an unpaid internship, and then moving to a paid junior developer position is very cool, and it demonstrates her permanent devotion and commitment to this field.  

However I do think that the title of her article causes damage to every software developer in the industry. It just simply sends the wrong message. Believe me, lot's of people will just read the title, and move on. Because it's catchy, the message will stay in their mind. Let me tell you what her title tells anybody:

> Software engineering is so easy - even a fashion model can do it!

And I think this is the wrong message. Being a software developer takes a lot of effort. It requires commitment, constant learning. It is about understanding and solving problems. And these things are hard. The solutions we are building today are complex beasts, running on cloud providers, interacting with each other (oh how many issues this topic brings to the table), sometimes learning and evolving by themselves, they require constant caring - testing, automated deployment processes, etc. And these are just the technological issues. There is a whole lot more issues on the business side. Just a few of the questions which we need to answer when designing a solution:

- Are we doing the right thing? 
- What are the possible solutions for this problem? 
- Did we already solved the problem?
- How will we make a solution which solves not just this particular problem but the problem in general?
- Is the chosen solution the most feasible (and cheapest) given our constraints? 

And the list of questions goes on.By answering these questions we are generating enermous value for our employers. And we are rare. we are so
